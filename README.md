# Pomadoro-App
Learning Xamarin by creating a simple pomadoro timer
This app was built using Visual Studio Community using a single page template.  It isues a basic timer to count down pomodors and switch to break intervals automatically.  Currently it's very simple, but I'd like to build upon this to learn how to save settings, session stats, and maybe try my hand at making the UI a bit nicer.


##TODO List
* Move Labels into Resources
* Add an icon
* Add Settings screen
* Make Timer values configurable
* Add Stats
* Refactor
* Change button color when in Break State
